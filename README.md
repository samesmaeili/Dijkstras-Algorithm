# Dijkstra's Algorithm

In the Dijkstra's Algorithm project, there are two files.
The first file is called dijkstra, which contains the main method and sub methods. 
The second file is called Vertex, which is a class for vertices, containing methods and instance variables.

In the main method of the dijkstra class, the dijkstra algorithm is demonstrated through an example.
In the example, several vertices are created and operations are conducted on every vertex.

The results of the algorithm are displayed to the console.
